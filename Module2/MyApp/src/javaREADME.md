# Overview
{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}
I have made a tic tac toe program. The user can input a number 1-9 to place Xs on the board.
The computer places Os on the board. 

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I wanted to make a simple game in Java. This was to learn some basic knowledge of how Java works.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough 
of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
