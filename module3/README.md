# Overview
{Provide a description the game that you wrote. Describe how to play your game.}
I created a hangman game in Python. First, the computer chooses a word. Then, the user inputs a letter a letter to guess the word.
The user has 6 tries if they input the wrong letter. If they run out of lives, then the game ends. If they guess the correct word
before they run out of lives, then the player wins.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I wrote this software to refresh my memory with Python. I have not used the programming language in depth for a year, so this program
was built to remind myself of the basics of Python.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
