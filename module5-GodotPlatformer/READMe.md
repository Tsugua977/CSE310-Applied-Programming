I created a simple platformer player that can move left and right (left and righ arrow keys), jump (up arrow key), 
and dash (Z key).

I have wanted to start developing video games and I want to learn Godot to do so. Completing this project was
to see if I like Godot's structure and language and if it can help me develop games.

# Development Environment
I used Godot, a programmed game maker. I also used VSCode to upload my code as the Github library in Godot would
not load.

Godot has it's own language, called GDScript. I tried using the Github intergration to uplaod from Godot, but it 
would not load.

# Useful Websites
* [Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/)

# Future Work
* Dash needs to work while left or right arrow key is being pressed down.
* Dash need to not be affected by gravity.
* Tweak gravity, acceleration, friction, etc, so the player feels more fluid.
