# Overview
{Provide a description the game that you wrote. Describe how to play your game.}
The game is a bare bones Space Shooter. User can control the ship with the left and right arrow keys. Users can also shoot
with the Z key.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I wanted to try to create a simple video game in python as I am interested in video game design. The purpose of using python was
to test out multiple programs that can make video games. I want to figure out which program one I like best.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
