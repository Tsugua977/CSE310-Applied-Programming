I wrote a RPG battle simulator. The player can attack, drink a potion to heal, use a thunder spell for more 
damage, and run away to end the game. The enemy attacks the player after the player attacks. If the enemy's 
health is reduced to zero, the player wins. If player's health is reduced to zero, the player loses.

I wrote this software to help me learn C++. I have never used this language before and wanted to get a better 
grasp on it.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio 2022 to program in C++. I could not get the correct applications to work for C++ to run 
in Virtual Studio Code.

I do not beleive any libraries were used for this module.

# Future Work
* Fix the random generation of attack damage.
* Make health potions limited.
* Put random attack generation into functions.
